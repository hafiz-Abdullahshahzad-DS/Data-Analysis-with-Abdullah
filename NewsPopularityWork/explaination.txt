can you help me with my projet :Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the popularity of articles based on metadata associated with these articles.
1. Loading and Preparing Real Data
Consider the popularity dataset available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thehapyone/uci-online-news-popularity-data-set
1. Load the dataset and describe it, with particular attention to the target variable and its relationships
with the explanatory variables, one by one.
2. Prediction
Our initial interest lies in the problem of prediction.
2. Select three prediction methods(with justification) and apply the following dimensionality
reduction methods: - None - PCA (Principal Component Analysis) - UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
These combinations provide nine potential prediction methods for your problem. Discuss their respective advantages and disadvantages and the usefulness of dimensionality reduction in this context. Implement all
or some of these methods and decide which you would choose
3. Evaluate the performance of each method, both generally and based on the actual value of the target variable.
3. Variable Selection and Influence
Now, we focus on dimension reduction through the selection of relevant variables.
4. Perform a reduction using the following approaches: - A penalized linear model with stability selection.
- A selection based on a threshold for variable correlation with the target, followed by a chosen prediction
method.
Which method do you retain? What variables are preserved?
5. Only if everything else is completed: conduct a study on the relative importance of variables within
this reduced model.
